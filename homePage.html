        <p class="sectionP">
            My name is Brian Cerda. For the last 3 years of typing this out.
            I have embarked on a journey to learn how to become a software engineer. 
            Since I began, I have discovered my passion for coding and have constantly been 
            impressed with the possibilities that have come with my growth. I began my pursuit 
            of the subject back in 2021 by enrolling in the Computer Science degree program at
            Kingsborough Community College. Originally, I was a Liberal Arts major, but wanted to 
            try switching majors since I had an initial interest in computers since I was a teenager.
            Since then I have been working hard to grow as a software engineer.

            I know the field can be very complicated for anyone. Alot of the subject matters that you will learn are
            things that exist within a level of abstraction that can make it very hard to understand. But in this day and age, 
            We are privileged with multiple viable outputs of information that can assist us in our struggle. Remember that 
            struggle promotes growth and we are all able to this subject no matter who we are and what we have been through.
